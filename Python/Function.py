"""
Python Functions
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

Based on the scope, we can classify Python variables into three types:


************Python Variable Scope
In Python, we can declare variables in three different scopes: local scope, global, and nonlocal scope.

Local Variables
Global Variables
Nonlocal Variables

# # Python Local Variables
# def greet():
#     # local variable
#     message = 'Hello'
#
#     print('Local', message)
#
#
# greet()
#
# # try to access message variable
# # outside greet() function
# print(message)              #NameError: name 'message' is not defined



# # Python Global Variables
# # In Python, a variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as a global
# # variable. This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function.
#
# # declare global variable
# message = 'Hello'
#
# def greet():
#     # declare local variable
#     print('Local', message)
#
# greet()
# print('Global', message)


print("----Python Recursion----")
# Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
